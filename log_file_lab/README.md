# python_automations
Small python scripts to automate different IT tasks.
This repository's **vcs** is being handled by git using ***MINGW64***

## Errors From Log Files ##
This script is designed to extract specific errors requested by user to be searched for 
extracted from **log files**.

*First* 
We look for the desired log file and look at its **Path** and contents

*Secondly*
We go to the directly of our choice to create a script there in **Nano**

*Third*
We change the script into an executable

*Final step*
Finally we run our script and type in the specific results were looking for

Here are the *results* from our query and the file is created in the specified *Path* provided 
in the script.

These following steps are just the steps I took to relocate the images for this readme from my local
directory to a local repo and uploaded to this remote repo

*first* 
Move the desired directory to the local repo

*Finally*
I went through the traditional steps:
git add
git commit(quick commit with one line message)
git push
git status(to check the files tracked)
