# This program takes in a Log file and displays the total errors found by category, as well as listing the usage of a network by different users # 

**First step**

we look at the system log in the file *syslog.log*

**Second step**

We look at a list of all the users in the network

![users](https://github.com/r0meroh/python_automations/blob/master/log_analysis_with_regEx/log_pictures/users.PNG)


**Third step**

we look at the prototype of the logic we are going to use. We know we need to use regular expressions and a dictionary.
Here we give a quick unsaved example of both with a preview of how they may be used in our script.

**Fourth step**

Here is the script finished. We also make it into an executable.

**Done**

Here is the finished product all written out to the browser using our python script for easy readability.
