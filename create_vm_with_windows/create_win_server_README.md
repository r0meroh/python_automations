# Create a server with a Virtual Machine(VM) using Windows Server and Remote
# Desktop

## First step

As mentioned before, this will not focus on the repeated steps in other labs/projects when creating a VM.

For this instance of a VM we have to select **Windows Server** as the OS.

## Second step

We now have to check if our VM is up and running before we can log into the
server to modify it.

## Third step

Once we get the message from the GLI, we can click on our Server instance and attain a generated password.

## Last step

Connect to the Windows server with Remote Desktop using the password that was generated.
